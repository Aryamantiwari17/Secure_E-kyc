# Secure_E-KYC

## Project Overview
The Secure_E-KYC project addresses the electronic Know Your Customer (e-KYC) process with a comprehensive approach:

1. **Examination of Existing e-KYC Methodologies**: In-depth analysis of current methods to understand their strengths and limitations.
2. **Development of a Deep Learning Model**: Creating a state-of-the-art deep learning model for robust identity verification through Aadhar integration, focusing on accuracy, data security, and privacy.
3. **Integration with Front-End Systems**: Simplifying the onboarding process for demat accounts and banking services by integrating Aadhar, enhancing user experience with intuitive interfaces and efficient workflows.

This project aims to revolutionize the e-KYC landscape, making identity verification processes more efficient, secure, and user-friendly in the financial sector.
